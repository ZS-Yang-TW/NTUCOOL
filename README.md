## Test APIs in Swagger
To test APIs with Swagger, follow these steps:

1. Once your application is running, open a web browser.
2. Navigate to the Swagger UI URL : [http://localhost:3000/api](http://localhost:3000/api)

To test the API endpoints which need Authorizations, input the token `cool` directly through the Swagger interface. ("Authorize" button can usually found at the top of the page.)
